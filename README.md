## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to easily:

- Implement authentication with multiple identity providers, including social (e.g., Google, Facebook, Microsoft, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, etc.), or enterprise (e.g., Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS, SAML, etc.)
- Log in users with username/password databases, passwordless, or multi-factor authentication
- Link multiple user accounts together
- Generate signed JSON Web Tokens to authorize your API calls and flow the user identity securely
- Access demographics and analytics detailing how, when, and where users are logging in
- Enrich user profiles from other data sources using customizable JavaScript rules

[Why Auth0?](https://auth0.com/why-auth0) Because you should save time, be happy, and focus on what really matters: building your product.
