# auth0-kickoff-korea

This sample app is a combination of different Auth0 sample apps slightly revised to be used for Auth0 Kickstart Workshop.

## How to use the repository

Auth0 Kickstart Workshop instruction can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CK9p397NxfZKDAlUBOvs0rOJ6swdha1d/view?usp=sharing). The sample app is designed to show you how fast and easy it is to add Auth to your apps when you use Auth0.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to easily:

- Implement authentication with multiple identity providers, including social (e.g., Google, Facebook, Microsoft, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, etc.), or enterprise (e.g., Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS, SAML, etc.)
- Log in users with username/password databases, passwordless, or multi-factor authentication
- Link multiple user accounts together
- Generate signed JSON Web Tokens to authorize your API calls and flow the user identity securely
- Access demographics and analytics detailing how, when, and where users are logging in
- Enrich user profiles from other data sources using customizable JavaScript rules

[Why Auth0?](https://auth0.com/why-auth0) Because you should save time, be happy, and focus on what really matters: building your product.
